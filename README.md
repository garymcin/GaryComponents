This repro is a work in progress. It is a study of other's components, such as  Zarko Gajic, Jedi, delphiarea.com, Steve Zimmelman and others. There are data aware components that add a field modified event.  There is a component to place on db grid that will allow for the setting of visible fields and saves the grid's column order and size.  There are two compound components. One for updating your app. It looks like a status bar at the bottom of a form. It has one button and two labels.  It uses a thread to check for updates and to download an install file. It runs a updater app that closes all other apps that you set it to. It then runs your installer (This app is not currently on GitHub). It is the combination of a TCustomGridPanel, TcolorButton, and 2 tJvLabels.  The other is combo of a TCustomPanel and a TImage to create a button with a large caption and a image that has all the properties of an image component.
